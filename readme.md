I built this set of notebooks, during period where I was searching for a new job, as a way to build a quick snapshot of potential employers by analyzing the language they used to describe themselves.  

It has a simple web scraper which crawls through and pulls the text from a (company's) website.  The scraped text is then fed to sentiment and LDA analysis models.
